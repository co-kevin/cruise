  "description": "In modern agile software development practice, there is a development practice called \"Continuous Integration (CI)\", which needs to generate  a deployable version at any time, any place. Usually in the actual development, the developer push the code  to the code library, and this will automatically trigger a series of actions, such as code checking, compiling, running testing, packaging. These steps are run through automated scripts to a group of servers, and we would like to create a product like CRUISE, which can easily manage these servers, monitor or set the status.",
